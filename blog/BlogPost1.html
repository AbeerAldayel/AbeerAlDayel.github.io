    <div class="post-body">

        <p><em>In memory of my beloved father, who passed away on 28 July 2025.</em></p>

        <p>
            Life unfolds in moments we wish hadn’t occurred, yet it continues to hone and refine us.
            Everyone carries their share of pain and suffering. Some choose to voice it, while others
            honor it in silence, practicing what we call <strong>“صبر جميل”</strong>—a beautiful patience
            that does not seek to spread sorrow, fearing it might weaken other souls.
            Instead, it strives to be a light for others, knowing that life is not easy for anyone.
        </p>

        <p>
            With graceful patience, this is my share—not to burden anyone, but to honor my beloved father.
            The quiet soul who fought a devastating disease for the past two years.
            His strength during that time was my shoulder to lean on, his courage lifting my spirit
            even in the midst of his own deepest pain.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey was defined by his unwavering support. He walked beside me in every chapter
            of my story, turning my dreams into our shared victories.
        </p>

        

        <p>
            My father was a mathematician—one of the rare people I have known who truly lived
            the passion of his science. He was my first reference for discussing metrics,
            our favorite subject: verification methods and scores.
            Yet what I learned from him went far beyond numbers.
        </p>

        <p>
            He taught me to notice the details, to never ignore the signs—especially the negative ones.
        </p>

        <p>He used to say:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Watch for the minus sign before the plus.  
            The negative is not a mistake, nor something to be ignored.  
            It is a given—it does not weaken the equation; it adds to its unique meaning.
            It must be included.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            He would even emphasize this with a long dash, making the minus massively visible,
            even if it made the digit beside it appear tiny.
        </p>

        <p>
            He taught me that what is missing is not erased, but acknowledged and reworked into meaning.
            In life, as in math, we count losses not as absence, but as part of the whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have carried my share of negatives far too early in life.
            Still, these minuses are like terms in a long equation.
            They are not meant to cancel the outcome; they reshape the parameters of the journey.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal is not simply to reach a positive result—life has never been purely smooth or positive
            for anyone. Instead, the goal is to arrive at an outcome with lasting impact and meaning,
            one that does not dim the essence of motion, but deepens the expression of the equation
            by adding new terms.
        </p>

        <p>
            True patience is not quiet endurance alone.
            It is the awareness that even the minus has meaning—and that meaning reshapes us.
        </p>

        <p>
            He spoke wisdom in fragments, and I became who I am because he believed I could.
        </p>

        <p>
            As life unfolds beyond what I ever imagined, I draw strength from his faith,
            his patience, and the love he planted in my heart—honoring his legacy in my prayers,
            and carrying his kindness forward.
        </p>

            “The thing about death is that it’s not just the person who dies.
            It’s the endless versions of them—the moments, the memories,
            the conversations you’ll never have.”  
            <br>— Matt Haig,</br> <em>The Midnight Library</em> 
        </blockquote>

        <p dir="rtl" style="text-align: right;">
            الحمدلله على ما قضى وقدر.  
            اللهم ارحم من كان سندي ويميني،  
            واغفر لمن كان قطعة من قلبي.  
            اللهم ارحم فقيدي واغفر له مغفرةً تبلغه جنتك يا الله.
